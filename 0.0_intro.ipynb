    "# Factiva Sample Notebooks - Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "With the aim to help speed up the solution development when connecting to Factiva Analytics services, the current set of notebooks allows getting started with the main concepts and implementing quick samples of most of the available operations. These notebooks rely on Factiva Analytics Python Library, also known as RDL (Rapid Development Library), a package set that makes interaction with Factiva APIs easier and more intuitive.\n",

    "All notebooks in this repository use RDL packages. For more details about all available operations, please refer to the official documentation.\n",
