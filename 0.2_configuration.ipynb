    "# Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",

This makes the library versatile for deployments and its use not only at test or development stages, but also for production.\n",

    "\n",
    "When working in Jupyter Notebooks, it is a good practice not typing sensitive information (e.g. user key) in the code or markup fields. Thus, the recommended approach is using a .env file that can be interpreted as environment variables by the package `dotenv`. Please [check out the detailed documentation of the `dotenv` package](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) if you face some difficulties setting the environment variables.\n",
