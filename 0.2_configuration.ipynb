    "\n",
    "When working in Jupyter Notebooks, it is a good practice not typing sensitive information (e.g. user key) in the code or markup fields. Thus, the recommended approach is using a .env file that can be interpreted as environment variables by the package `dotenv`. Please [check out the detailed documentation of the `dotenv` package](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) if you face some difficulties setting the environment variables.\n",
