    "# Building Queries for Snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a query is the most important part of data selection. It can have implications on how relevant the selected data is for the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide in this process, Snapshot operations use the `SnapshotQuery` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SnapshotQuery class\n",
    "A query is at its minimum a where statement. However, this class offers additional attributes to support specific operations like Analytics or Extraction. A detailed description of the syntax, fields and potential values can be seen in the [Data Selection Samples - Dow Jones Developer Portal](https://developer.dowjones.com/site/docs/data_selection_samples/index.gsp).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`where`**: _Required_, _Positional_. String that specifies the Where statement as used in Google BigQuery SQL Sytnax.\n",
    "* **`includes`**: _Optional_, _Default: `None`_. Object-type syntax that specifies the list of fields and values to include in bulk. Value can be set as ```{\"company_codes\": ['mcrost', 'applc'] }```\n",
    "* **`excludes`**: _Optional_, _Default: `None`_. Object-type syntax that specifies the list of fields and values to exclude in bulk. Value can be set as ```{\"subject_codes\": ['gspo', 'nnam'] }```\n",
    "* **`frequency`**: _Optional_, _Default: `'MONTH'`_. Frequency to aggregate results. Possible values are `'MONTH'`, `'YEAR'` or `'DAY'`. Used only by the Analytics operation.\n",
    "* **`date_field`**: _Optional_, _Default: `'publication_datetime'`_. Date-time field used to aggregate. Possible values are `'publication_datetime'`, `'ingestion_datetime'` and `'modification_datetime'`. Used only by the Analytics operation.\n",
    "* **`group_by_source_code`**: _Optional_, _Default: `False`_. Specifies if the results will contain only a year field (`False`), or if each year will be broken-down by source (`True`). Used only by the Analytics operation.\n",
    "* **`top`**: Valid only if ```group_by_source_code``` is True. Limits the number of sources used to group the content by frequency. Used only by the Analytics operation.\n",
    "* **`file_format`**: _Optional_, _Default: `'avro'`_. File format to be used for Extractions. Possible values are `'avro'`, `'csv'` or `'json'`. Used only by the Extraction operation.\n",
    "* **`limit`**: _Optional_, _Default: `0` (No limit)_. Positive integer that limits the amount of documents to extract. Used only by the Extraction operation.\n"
